# Haskell Http Server

This is a server built following the codecrafters challenge.

I challenge myself to finish it in one sitting one evening, so its very rough around the edges I may
revisit it in the future.

The code is written to match exactly the test cases and simply pass so there is little
error handling. Its a very delicate setup.

I really enjoyed this challenge it was good to get back to using concurrency and Monads like Reader and Either.

To run this use the bash script attached, the api calls can be inferred from the code.

I hope to revisit this later and built is out to be a more series project
